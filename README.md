How to compile and run my java application on a Windows or Linux Machine from the command line using downloadable trace files:<br />
[MINIFE.t](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VT88k8sWPrV9LTUu_ndKNhsMzejNpD-Z/view?usp=sharing)<br />
[XSBENCH.t](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VT88k8sWPrV9LTUu_ndKNhsMzejNpD-Z/view?usp=sharing)<br />


1. Navigate inside the directory named source-code. Make sure the trace files are placed in the same directory.  

2. To compile use the command:
`javac *java`

3. To run use the command:
`java -Xmx2048m Main <CACHE_SIZE> <ASSOCIATIVITY> <REPLACEMENT_POLICY> <WRITE_BACK_POLICY> <TRACE_FILE>`

`Replace <CACHE_SIZE> with a value between 8KB and 128KB, make sure value is a power of 2.<br />`
`Replace <ASSOCIATIVITY> with a value between 1 and 64, make sure value is a power of 2.<br />`
`Replace <REPLACEMENT_POLICY> with a 0 to represent LRU, or a 1 to represent FIFO.<br />`
`Replace <WRITE_BACK_POLICY> with a 0 to represent write-through, or a 1 to represent write-back.<br />`
`Replace <TRACE_FILE> with MINIFE.t or XSBENCH.t.<br />

Example:<br /> 
javac *java<br />
java -Xmx2048m Main 32768 8 1 1 XSBENCH.t
